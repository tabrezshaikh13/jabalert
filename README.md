# jabalert

Designed, developed and built a web portal that automates the process of checking vaccination slots on
CoWIN and alerts the registered user through email whenever there is a slot available at their vaccination center.
The portal was hosted for almost 4 months on Amazon Web Services (AWS) completely and gained around 130 users all over India.
This automation was done using technologies like Java and Spring Boot at the backend, MySQL for storing user's data and
Thymeleaf to render the frontend and using publicly avaible CoWIN API to search for available vaccination slots at a particular pincode.
